## Projects

### Data Scientist In-demand Skills Dashboard [Link](https://github.com/osamadel/data_skills_demand)

- Scrapped around 400 data scientist job postings from LinkedIn
- Extracted job skills from the job descriptions using a pre-trained Named Entity Recognition model from HuggingFace
- Visualized the findings using Tableau and built an application using Streamlit to filter job skills requirements based on country, seniority level and other factors
- Made a series of videos explaining how it's done [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6tO1GDK4wQ&list=PLeaehAJ_QLq_E4oUPIdF2WJ36IZsBH_KJ)


### Inertial Gait-based Person Authentication Using Siamese Networks [Link](https://github.com/osamadel/inertial-siamese)
- Proposed a Siamese Network-based framework for inertial gait-based person authentication
- The proposed framework allows for learning a model on a set of subjects and being tested on a totally different set of subject (authenticate new subjects) without retraining the model from scratch.
